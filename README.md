The Problem
My wife lives and works in the East Bay and had a work event in San Francisco. She gets cold relatively easily and asked me if I thinks she needed a jacket. I had no idea, so I looked up the weather for 5pm in San Francisco and made a guess that she would need one. 

I figure she should be able to cut the middle man, me.

The Solution
She should have her google calender connected to a service that can check the weather for events on her calender. It could take the location and time of the event specific time e.g. SOMA between 5pm - 7pm. It could then advise the user of the predicted temperature/chill factor/chance of rain. From there it could advise the user what to bring, e.g. Bring an Umbrella or bring a heavy coat.
