# Brolly-WebApp


## Introduction:
My wife lives and works in the East Bay and had a work event in San Francisco. She gets cold relatively easily and asked me if I thinks she needed a jacket. I had no idea, so I looked up the weather for 5pm in San Francisco and made a guess that she would need one. 

I figure she should be able to cut the middle man, me.

The Solution
She should have her google calender connected to a service that can check the weather for events on her calender. It could take the location and time of the event specific time e.g. SOMA between 5pm - 7pm. It could then advise the user of the predicted temperature/chill factor/chance of rain. From there it could advise the user what to bring, e.g. Bring an Umbrella or bring a heavy coat.


## Prerequisites:
1. Gmail account
2. Google Calendar


## How Brolly App Work:
1. Connect google calendar events to hyper local weather
2. Get exact time and exact location of event in google calendar
3. Search dark sky for the weather at that time/location 
4. Search once at the start of the day
5. Search again 1 hour before event starts in case there is an update and to get “hyperlocal next hour precipitation forecasts”
6. Build an interface (website) that can display a list of today’s event and the related weather
7. Allow users to set up alerts via email/slack/something else. E.g. receive an alert at 7am each day for what to wear/bring for the days activities.
